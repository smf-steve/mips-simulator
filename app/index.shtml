  <p> This is the start of the MIPS simulator written in Vue.</p>
  <p> What we currently have depicted is the various planned panels for simulator.  Each panel (via its banner) is draggable, which will be used later to flesh out the visual design. </p>
  <p> The panels allow us to see the local state of the simulator as it is developed.
